Jennifer is a 28 year old part -time front desk receptionist at a local community centre. She is currently back in school at Humber College studying to be a Social Service Worker diploma. She is a bright and energetic young woman who loves to travel. Having grown up in Canada, she decided to backpack across south-east asia after she graduated from high school. During her travels in Asia she met an older Canadian man, Brent Hadley, whom she fell in love with, it was a whirlwind romance. After three years of travelling together they moved back to Hamilton and decided to start their lives together. Wong and Hadley had a son, James, in 2003 who suffered a debilitating head injury at the age of 2 causing him to develop aphasia, an impairment in the language processing region of the brain. Jennifer's husband is an independently wealthy consultant, and is able to provide more than adequately for his his wife and child. Unfortunately due to James' condition he required much more supervision and parental guidance causing Jennifer to have to stay at home and be with him during the day. In particular it was very difficult for James to attend school as he needed special accomodations due to his learning disability. Since adjusting to James' situation Jennifer has spent most of her free time speaking to other mothers who have an aphasic child and working with organizations to try and develop better education and services for children with learning disabilities. During her work with these non-for profit organizations she realized that she was particularly interested in working with individuals to provide them better access to social services. Since Brent has started working from home, and James is getting older, with the help of a part-time carer, Jennifer has had the chance to go to school and pursue her goals. Working at Storefront provides another way for her to get to know the community she grew up with, and contribute to the collaboration of different projects. Since she is still in school at the moment it is hard for her to be fully engaged with all the different projects, and working part time is the perfect fit for her at the moment. </p>


Jennifer is very effective at using new and emergent technologies. Her dad was in IT and she grew up around computers. She had also been a pretty intense gamer in her youth. Now she is connected via LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and blogs about new trends in social services. She owns an iPhone, and an iPad tablet which she uses to keep updated with current events on the GO train commute to work. Part of Jennifer's duties working at Storefront is to facilitate the booking process between an organization and the community centre. Since she has a very busy lifestyle, being both a mother and a student, she needs a reliable way to access the system while on-the-go, and refer to it from any where she it, whether at home, work, or school. </p>
