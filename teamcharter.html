	<h1>Team Charter</h1>
	<p>The team charter shows the time commitments and promises we have made with each other.</p>

	<font size= "2">
		<b>Meetings</b>:We will have two meetings weekly of which Meeting A is mandatory, and Meeting B is optional. Both meetings require notes to be taken, and a summary of minutes to be recorded and e-mailed out.</>
	
	<ul> A: Thursday 11AM-12PM, BA2159 </br>
	B: Monday 10:30PM, Google Hangouts </ul></p>

	<b>Communication</b>: We will keep in touch through e-mail during the week, with a maximum of 24hrs to reply. All team members can be reached through text if individual meetings times have to be co-ordinated. </p>
	<b>Transparency</b>: We would all liked to be CC'ed on correspondences between team members and product champion. After the completion of a task an update should be given to the team, either by pushing to GIT, or through e-mail. </p>
	<b>Weekly</b>: It is important to stay on top of lectures as they contribute to the weekly sprints. Members who are not in attendance of the meetings must let us know in advance and be on top of the consequent meeting minutes and send in any relevant information (what I've done, what I will do, any concerns). </p>
	<b>Help</b>: If there are any individual problems or concerns we will inform each other as soon as we are aware of the situation. If an individual task seems too large we will ask each other for help. No judgements, and no criticism (unless constructive).</p>
	<b>Persistence</b>: We will all take turns reminding each other of due dates. We will all take turns trying to get into contact with the product champion. We will be persistent and we will persevere!</p>
