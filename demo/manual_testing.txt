Go to the project directory and run this command: "python manage.py shell"
Then "from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group"

1. Make a dummy user in "user" group and check if the page recognizes it after login.
	- Type in Python shell: "user = User.objects.create_user(username="jeff", password="123")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group = Group.objects.create(name="user")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group.user_set.add(user)"
	- Now, go to the page and check if login works with above information.
	- A massege should show "Login Success. Group: user"

2. Make a dummy user in "booker" group and check if the page recognizes it after login.
	- Type in Python shell: "user = User.objects.create_user(username="lia", password="123")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group = Group.objects.create(name="booker")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group.user_set.add(booker)"
	- Now, go to the page and check if login works with above information.
	- A massege should show "Login Success. Group: booker"

3. Make a dummy user in "admin" group and check if the page recognizes it after login.
	- Type in Python shell: "user = User.objects.create_user(username="tae", password="123")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group = Group.objects.create(name="admin")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group.user_set.add(admin)"
	- Now, go to the page and check if login works with above information.
	- A massege should show "Login Success. Group: admin"

4. Check if a dummy user who does not fall into any of the groups cannot login.
	- Type in Python shell: "user = User.objects.create_user(username="winston", password="123")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group = Group.objects.create(name="random")"
	- Type in Python shell: "group.user_set.add(random)"
	- Now, go to the page and check if login works with above information.
	- A massege should show "Weird"
