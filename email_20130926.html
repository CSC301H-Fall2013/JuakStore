Hello Jaime,


My name is Winston, and I am part of Team Amajuak from the software engineering course at U of T. We were wondering if you would possibly have time to meet with us next week to further iron out details of the project.

Would be okay with you to meet us on or near campus? Unfortunately due to tight scheduling with class and the commute to Storefront, finding an optimal meeting time at Storefront is a little difficult. Here are our available times:


On/Near Campus:
Monday, September 30: 2-3PM
Tuesday, October 1: Before 2PM, after 6PM
Wednesday, October 2: Before 12PM, after 2PM

At Storefront:
Tuesday, October 1: Before 12PM
Wednesday, October 2: Before 10AM


Please email back with a time that would work for you, if these times are inconvenient for you we'll try to work something out to the best of our ability.


Thank you!
</p>
