	<h1>Project Charter</h1>

	<font size = "2">

		The East Scarborough Storefront is a community resource space which serves as a meeting place for over 35 partner agencies. Storefront is currently using an outdated scheduling software that is installed on 3 individual PC's in the office. They are looking to update the system to a web application that can be accessed from multiple devices at different locations in order to streamline their organization. </p>

		The new system should be able to cater to three different user types, all who have differing levels of authority and access. The client should only be able to view room availability and their past bookings. The booker should be able to view all schedules, have access to client information, and make requests for room bookings. The supervisor should be able to do what the client and booker can do, as well as accept room booking requests, and make changes to bookings. </p>

		During this update, Storefront would like to add a visual representation of the facility as well as a few extra features that were not found in their previous software, such as prompt for canceling a booking, or undoing actions in the system.</p>

		Our goals for the project are to meet Storefront's criteria in a timely and effective manner: </br>
	<ul>
			<li>End product should be accessible on the web </li>
			<li>End product should be intuitive and easy to use</li>
			<li>End product should have a simple interface and aesthetically pleasing</li>
			<li>End product should not have the pitfalls of the previous system (e.g. error prone, always crashes)</li>
			<li>End product should enable different levels of access for different users</li>
			<li>Code design will be clearly documented and commented for future extension</li>
			<li>Storefront will be excited to use our implementation</li>

		</ul>
